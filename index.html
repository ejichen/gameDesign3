<h1>Keep Your Shadow</h1>
<div id="author">by: I-Chen Jwo (ijwo)</div>
<p>Your shadow tries to run away from you, try to keep it from contacting other object's shadow.</p>
<!-- the <div> wrapping this image centers it on the page. -->
<!-- TODO: drawing showing the main view of the game during play -->
<div class="figure">
<img src="game.png" />
</div>
<p>the player is moving around on a circle planer surface and there are objects on the planar as well.
Try to keep the player's shadow away from touching other objects and also try not to touch the
objects' shadow. For example, if the sun goes down a little bit further, the player's shadow might touch
obj1 and the shadow of obj2 might touch the player. That will let your shadow run away!</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The sun will move around either orderly or randomly, that's up to the choice of the implementer.
Could use WASD keys to move around the viewpoint and the arrow keys to control the player. The player
wins higher score by keeping the shadow for a longer time.</p>
<!-- TODO: illustrate your descriptions with more drawings -->
<div class="figure">
<img src="sun.png" />
<!-- <img src="after-reset.png" /> -->
</div>

<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>Could use the  <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f18/game0-designs/default/stickochet.blend">old assets</a>  for the objects or use anything else instead.</p>
